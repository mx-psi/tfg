Our treatment places particular emphasis on the intimate connections that have been discovered between a variety of fundamental ``pseudorandom objects'' that at first seem very different in nature: expander graphs, randomness extractors, list-decodable error-correcting codes, samplers, and pseudorandom generators. The structure of the presentation is meant to be suitable for teaching in a graduate-level course, with exercises accompanying each section.},

Here I survey the status of this problem in 2016, for a broad audience of mathematicians, scientists, and engineers.

The discussion of progress includes diagonalization and circuit lower bounds; the relativization, algebrization, and natural proofs barriers; and the recent works of Ryan Williams and Ketan Mulmuley, which (in different ways) hint at a duality between impossibility proofs and algorithms.},

This book is written as a graduate text and so aims to provide a reasonably self-contained introduction to this subject.

In a typical problem, we may be able to devise new algorithms for the problem that are more and more efficient. But eventually, this line of research often seems to hit an invisible barrier, a level beyond whch improvements are very difficult, seemingly impossible, to come by. After many unsuccessful attempts, algorithm designers inevitably start to wonder if there is something inherent in the problem that makes it impossible to devise algorithms that are faster than the current one. They may try to develop mathematical techniques for proving formally that there can be no algorithm for the given problem which runs faster than the current one. Such a proof would be valuable, as it would suggest that it is futile to keep working on improved algorithms for this problem, that further improvements are certainly impossible. The realm of mathematical models and techniques for establishing such impossibility proofs is called computational complexity.},

  isbn = {978-3-662-04565-7},

Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) Most natural optimization problems, including those arising in important application areas, are NP-hard. Therefore, under the widely believed con jecture that P -=/= NP, their exact solution is prohibitively time consuming. Charting the landscape of approximability of these problems, via polynomial time algorithms, therefore becomes a compelling subject of scientific inquiry in computer science and mathematics. This book presents the theory of ap proximation algorithms as it stands today. It is reasonable to expect the picture to change with time. This book is divided into three parts. In Part I we cover combinato rial algorithms for a number of important problems, using a wide variety of algorithm design techniques. The latter may give Part I a non-cohesive appearance. However, this is to be expected - nature is very rich, and we cannot expect a few tricks to help solve the diverse collection of NP-hard problems. Indeed, in this part, we have purposely refrained from tightly cat egorizing algorithmic techniques so as not to trivialize matters. Instead, we have attempted to capture, as accurately as possible, the individual character of each problem, and point out connections between problems and algorithms for solving them.},

Since the achievement of a formal definition of the concept of "algorithm", the Mathematical Theory of Computation has developed into a broad and rich discipline. The notion of "complexity of an algorithm" yields an important area of research, known as Complexity Theory, that can be approached from several points of view. The present Volume I is written in a style appropriate for undergraduate students who have taken a first course in Formal Language Theory. The first two chapters of this volume present the basic concepts of structural complexity, providing the background necessary for the understanding of complexity theory. Volume II will be addressed to graduate students and researchers. Both volumes are written in a textbook style; they contain about 200 exercises. The readers are led to a point where very little additional work will enable them to start research projects. In order to ease this step, an effort has been made to point out the main references for each of the results presented in the text.},

  abstract = {Query complexity is a model of computation in which we have to compute a function \$f(x\_1, \textbackslash{}ldots, x\_N)\$ of variables \$x\_i\$ which can be accessed via queries. The complexity of an algorithm is measured by the number of queries that it makes. Query complexity is widely used for studying quantum algorithms, for two reasons. First, it includes many of the known quantum algorithms (including Grover's quantum search and a key subroutine of Shor's factoring algorithm). Second, one can prove lower bounds on the query complexity, bounding the possible quantum advantage. In the last few years, there have been major advances on several longstanding problems in the query complexity. In this talk, we survey these results and related work, including: - the biggest quantum-vs-classical gap for partial functions (a problem solvable with 1 query quantumly but requiring \$\textbackslash{}Omega(\textbackslash{}sqrt\{N\})\$ queries classically); - the biggest quantum-vs-determistic and quantum-vs-probabilistic gaps for total functions (for example, a problem solvable with \$M\$ queries quantumly but requiring \$\textbackslash{}tilde\{\textbackslash{}Omega\}(M\^\{2.5\})\$ queries probabilistically); - the biggest probabilistic-vs-deterministic gap for total functions (a problem solvable with \$M\$ queries probabilistically but requiring \$\textbackslash{}tilde\{\textbackslash{}Omega\}(M\^\{2\})\$ queries deterministically); - the bounds on the gap that can be achieved for subclasses of functions (for example, symmetric functions); - the connections between query algorithms and approximations by low-degree polynomials.},

          {$\Pi$}

            2


        =

        .



    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle \textbackslash{}mathrm \{PH\} =\textbackslash{}Sigma \_\{2\}.\textbackslash,\}

That is, if we assume that NP, the class of nondeterministic polynomial time problems, can be contained in the non-uniform polynomial time complexity class P/poly, then this assumption implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy at its second level. Such a collapse is believed unlikely, so the theorem is generally viewed by complexity theorists as evidence for the nonexistence of polynomial size circuits for SAT or for other NP-complete problems. A proof that such circuits do not exist would imply that P {$\not =$} NP. As P/poly contains all problems solvable in randomized polynomial time (Adleman's theorem), the Karp\textendash{}Lipton theorem is also evidence that the use of randomization does not lead to polynomial time algorithms for NP-complete problems.
The Karp\textendash{}Lipton theorem is named after Richard M. Karp and Richard J. Lipton, who first proved it in 1980. (Their original proof collapsed PH to




          {$\Sigma$}

            3




    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle \textbackslash{}Sigma \_\{3\}\}
  , but Michael Sipser improved it to




          {$\Sigma$}

            2




    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle \textbackslash{}Sigma \_\{2\}\}
  .)
Variants of the theorem state that, under the same assumption, MA = AM, and PH collapses to SP2 complexity class. There are stronger conclusions possible if PSPACE, or some other complexity classes are assumed to have polynomial-sized circuits; see P/poly. If NP is assumed to be a subset of BPP (which is a subset of P/poly), then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to BPP. If coNP is assumed to be subset of NP/poly, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its third level.},

  title = {The Computational Landscape of General Physical Theories},
  abstract = {The emergence of quantum computers has challenged long-held beliefs about what is efficiently computable given our current physical theories. However, going back to the work of Abrams and Lloyd, changing one aspect of quantum theory can result in yet more dramatic increases in computational power, as well as violations of fundamental physical principles. Here we focus on efficient computation within a framework of general physical theories that make good operational sense. In prior work, Lee and Barrett showed that in any theory satisfying the principle of tomographic locality (roughly, local measurements suffice for tomography of multipartite states) the complexity bound on efficient computation is AWPP. This bound holds independently of whether the principle of causality (roughly, no signalling from the future) is satisfied. In this work we show that this bound is tight: there exists a theory satisfying both the principles of tomographic locality and causality which can efficiently decide everything in AWPP, and in particular can simulate any efficient quantum computation. Thus the class AWPP has a natural physical interpretation: it is precisely the class of problems that can be solved efficiently in tomographically-local theories. This theory is built upon a model of computing involving Turing machines with quasi-probabilities, to wit, machines with transition weights that can be negative but sum to unity over all branches. In analogy with the study of non-local quantum correlations, this leads us to question what physical principles recover the power of quantum computing. Along this line, we give some computational complexity evidence that quantum computation does not achieve the bound of AWPP.},

  abstract = {Quantum information and computation provide a fascinating twist on the notion of proofs in computational complexity theory. For instance, one may consider a quantum computational analogue of the complexity class \textbackslash{}class\{NP\}, known as QMA, in which a quantum state plays the role of a proof (also called a certificate or witness), and is checked by a polynomial-time quantum computation. For some problems, the fact that a quantum proof state could be a superposition over exponentially many classical states appears to offer computational advantages over classical proof strings. In the interactive proof system setting, one may consider a verifier and one or more provers that exchange and process quantum information rather than classical information during an interaction for a given input string, giving rise to quantum complexity classes such as QIP, QSZK, and QMIP* that represent natural quantum analogues of IP, SZK, and MIP. While quantum interactive proof systems inherit some properties from their classical counterparts, they also possess distinct and uniquely quantum features that lead to an interesting landscape of complexity classes based on variants of this model. In this survey we provide an overview of many of the known results concerning quantum proofs, computational models based on this concept, and properties of the complexity classes they define. In particular, we discuss non-interactive proofs and the complexity class QMA, single-prover quantum interactive proof systems and the complexity class QIP, statistical zero-knowledge quantum interactive proof systems and the complexity class \textbackslash{}class\{QSZK\}, and multiprover interactive proof systems and the complexity classes QMIP, QMIP*, and MIP*.},

  abstract = {We prove that constant-depth quantum circuits are more powerful than their classical counterparts. To this end we introduce a non-oracular version of the BernsteinVazirani problem which we call the 2D Hidden Linear Function problem. An instance of the problem is specified by a quadratic form q that maps n-bit strings to integers modulo four. The goal is to identify a linear boolean function which describes the action of q on a certain subset of n-bit strings. We prove that any classical probabilistic circuit composed of bounded fan-in gates that solves the 2D Hidden Linear Function problem with high probability must have depth logarithmic in n. In contrast, we show that this problem can be solved with certainty by a constant-depth quantum circuit composed of one- and two-qubit gates acting locally on a two-dimensional grid.},

Other aspects of the theory are the same as in quantum computing: superposition and linearity of the state space, unitarity of the transformations, and projective measurements. However, one notable exception is the fact that quaternionic circuits do not have a uniquely defined behaviour, unless a total ordering of evaluation of the gates is defined. Given such an ordering a unique unitary operator can be associated with the quaternionic circuit and a proper semantics of computation can be associated with it.},

Still, there is currently a lack of programming languages for describing quantum computation on a practical scale, i.e., not just at the level of toy problems. We address this issue by introducing Quipper, a scalable, expressive, functional, higher-order quantum programming language. Quipper has been used to program a diverse set of non-trivial quantum algorithms, and can generate quantum gate representations using trillions of gates. It is geared towards a model of computation that uses a classical computer to control a quantum device, but is not dependent on any particular model of quantum hardware. Quipper has proven effective and easy to use, and opens the door towards using formal methods to analyze quantum algorithms.},

Specifically, given a special unitary U and a precision \{\textbackslash{}epsilon\} {$>$} 0, we show how to efficiently find a sequence of Clifford+V or Clifford+T operators whose product approximates U up to \{\textbackslash{}epsilon\} in the operator norm. In the general case, the length of the approximating sequence is asymptotically optimal. If the unitary to approximate is diagonal then our method is optimal: it yields the shortest sequence approximating U up to \{\textbackslash{}epsilon\}. Next, we introduce a mathematical formalization of a fragment of the Quipper quantum programming language. We define a typed lambda calculus called Proto-Quipper which formalizes a restricted but expressive fragment of Quipper. The type system of Proto-Quipper is based on intuitionistic linear logic and prohibits the duplication of quantum data, in accordance with the no-cloning property of quantum computation. We prove that Proto-Quipper is type-safe in the sense that it enjoys the subject reduction and progress properties.},

In these models it is difficult or impossible to deal formally with several central issues: measurements in the middle of the computation; decoherence and noise, using probabilistic subroutines, and more. It turns out, that the restriction to unitary gates and pure states is unnecessary. In this paper we generalize the formal model of quantum circuits to a model in which the state can be a general quantum state, namely a mixed state, or a ``density matrix'', and the gates can be general quantum operations, not necessarily unitary. The new model is shown to be equivalent in computational power to the standard one, and the problems mentioned above essentially disappear.},

We revisit the simulation of quantum Turing machines with uniformly generated quantum circuits, which is the more challenging of the two simulation tasks, and present a variation on the simulation method employed by Yao together with an analysis of it. This analysis reveals that the simulation of quantum Turing machines can be performed by quantum circuits having depth linear in t, rather than quadratic depth, and can be extended to variants of quantum Turing machines, such as ones having multi-dimensional tapes. Our analysis is based on an extension of a method of Arrighi, Nesme, and Werner (2011) that allows for the localization of causal unitary evolutions.},

  isbn = {978-1-4503-0445-0},
  abstract = {Randomized algorithms have been used to successfully address many different types of software engineering problems. This type of algorithms employ a degree of randomness as part of their logic. Randomized algorithms are useful for difficult problems where a precise solution cannot be derived in a deterministic way within reasonable time. However, randomized algorithms produce different results on every run when applied to the same problem instance. It is hence important to assess the effectiveness of randomized algorithms by collecting data from a large enough number of runs. The use of rigorous statistical tests is then essential to provide support to the conclusions derived by analyzing such data. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of the use of randomized algorithms in selected software engineering venues in 2009. Its goal is not to perform a complete survey but to get a representative snapshot of current practice in software engineering research. We show that randomized algorithms are used in a significant percentage of papers but that, in most cases, randomness is not properly accounted for. This casts doubts on the validity of most empirical results assessing randomized algorihtms. There are numerous statistical tests, based on different assumptions, and it is not always clear when and how to use these tests. We hence provide practical guidelines to support empirical research on randomized algorithms in software engineering.},

  abstract = {If a photon of definite polarization encounters an excited atom, there is typically some nonvanishing probability that the atom will emit a second photon by stimulated emission. Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.},

  abstract = {Imagine a phone directory containing N names arranged in completely random order. In order to find someone's phone number with a 50\% probability, any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need to look at a minimum of N/2 names. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired phone number can be obtained in only O(sqrt(N)) steps. The algorithm is within a small constant factor of the fastest possible quantum mechanical algorithm.},

  abstract = {A computer is generally considered to be a universal computational device; i.e., it is believed able to simulate any physical computational device with a cost in computation time of at most a polynomial factor: It is not clear whether this is still true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Linear type systems have a long and storied history, but not a clear path forward to integrate with existing languages such as OCaml or Haskell. In this paper, we study a linear type system designed with two crucial properties in mind: backwards-compatibility and code reuse across linear and non-linear users of a library. Only then can the benefits of linear types permeate conventional functional programming. Rather than bifurcate types into linear and non-linear counterparts, we instead attach linearity to function arrows. Linear functions can receive inputs from linearly-bound values, but can also operate over unrestricted, regular values.  To demonstrate the efficacy of our linear type system~\textemdash{}~both how easy it can be integrated in an existing language implementation and how streamlined it makes it to write programs with linear types~\textemdash{}~we implemented our type system in ghc, the leading Haskell compiler, and demonstrate two kinds of applications of linear types: mutable data with pure interfaces; and enforcing protocols in I/O-performing functions.},
