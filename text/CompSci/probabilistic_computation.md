# Probabilistic computation models

## Probabilistic models

:::{.definition}
TODO A probabilistic Turing machine
:::

The probabilistic circuit model is not usually studied but can easily be formed by adding a gate that outputs a random bit from a possibly biased Bernouilli random variable.

:::{.proposition}
Definition invariance by probability bias (see Arora and Barak)
One can simulate an arbitrary distribution
:::

## Probabilistic polynomial complexity

:::{.definition}
BPP
:::

:::{.proposition}
Error reduction on BPP by majority vote (Chernoff bounts)
:::

:::{.definition}
TODO PP
:::

:::{.example}
Problem which is in PP but we don't know wether it is in BPP
:::


### BPP properties

BPP vs PH
BPP vs P/Poly 
BPP vs EXP
Pseudorandomness

(mirar Arora y Barak)

### Semantic versus syntactic classes

:::{.definition}
Complete promise problem for BPP (ver Quantum proofs o On Promise Problems)
:::

:::{.proposition}
The language of BPP machines is undecidable 
:::

:::{.proposition}
1. Complete promise problem for BPP
:::

There are no complete problems with empty promise known for BPP

There are no hierarchy theorems


## Probabilistic polynomial time verifiers

:::{.definition}
TODO MA
:::

Graph non isomorphism is in MA
Mention derandomization
